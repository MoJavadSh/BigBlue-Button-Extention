# BigBlue Button Extension

A simple Chrome extension to control video playback speed and navigation on **BigBlueButton** and similar platforms.

## Why I Made This

While studying for exams, I found it annoying to deal with limited playback controls when watching university lectures and also I couldn't easily pause the video by pressing space bar. This extension fixes that problem by adding speed control and keyboard shortcuts.

## Features

- Change playback speed to **2.5x** or **3x**.
- Use keyboard shortcuts:
  - `Space`: Play/Pause.
  - `Arrow Right`: Skip 15 seconds forward.
  - `Arrow Left`: Skip 15 seconds backward.

## How to Install

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome.
3. Enable **Developer mode**.
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the folder with the extension files.

## How to Use

1. Open the extension from the toolbar.
2. Use the buttons to adjust speed or enable keyboard shortcuts.
3. Control videos on supported platforms like BigBlueButton.
4. By Enabling "Control Keys" you can now control playback by arrow keys and play/pause by space key
