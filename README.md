# BigBlue Button Extension

A simple Chrome extension to control video playback speed and navigation on **BigBlueButton** and similar platforms.

## Why I Made This

While studying for exams, I found it annoying to deal with limited playback controls when watching university lectures. This extension fixes that problem by adding speed control and keyboard shortcuts.

## Features

- Change playback speed to **2.5x** or **3x**.
- Use keyboard shortcuts:
  - `Space`: Play/Pause.
  - `Arrow Right`: Skip 15 seconds forward.
  - `Arrow Left`: Skip 15 seconds backward.

## How to Install

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome.
3. Enable **Developer mode**.
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the folder with the extension files.

## How to Use

1. Open the extension from the toolbar.
2. Use the buttons to adjust speed or enable keyboard shortcuts.
3. Control videos on supported platforms like BigBlueButton.
